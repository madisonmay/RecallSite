LoginRadius's node-js SDK is used to implement Social Login on your node-js website
==========

LoginRadius's node-js SDK is a development kit that lets you integrate Social Login through providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and over 20 more on a Node-js website. The SDK also fetches user profile data and can be customized from your LoginRadius user account. Ex: social icon sets, login interface, provider settings, etc.

Steps to implement LoginRadius node-js SDK
===

Step 1: Download the LoginRadius SDK and add it to your web project inside node_module directory.

  a. Copy the LoginRadius SDK file to your project directory.
  
  b. Include SDK class file on your callback page.
      
      var lr = require('LoginRadius');
      
Step 2: Create LoginRadius object in your code file

  On your callback page, create a LoginRadius object using your unique LoginRadius API Secret.
      
      lr.loginradiusauth(req.body.token ,'--YOUR API SECRET---');
          
Step 3: Validate, authenticate and store data from LoginRadius: 

Validate the object using 'IsAuthenticated' variable. After successful validation, access user profile data such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email using profile.ID, profile.FirstName, profile.LastName, etc.


Note: Few providers like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. doesn't provide email address with User Profile data, so you need to handle these cases in your callback page.
